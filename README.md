# DnD-Text-Game
Navigate a DnD 3.5 world, fight enemies and explore in text (WIP)

Created: August 24, 2019

The goal of this game is to create a text simulation of combat seen in Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) 3.5 Edition. This was inspired by a session of one of my DnD where there was quite a bit of random rolling and math calculations. I thought it'd be fun to make a program out of that.

Hopefully I get somewhat randomized enemies using a Full Binary Tree of possible enemies and letting the program choose its path randomly from level to level, starting with the root, a tutorial enemy.
